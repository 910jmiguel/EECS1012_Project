Problems Encountered/Solutions
Throughout the making of this project, we encountered several problems, which led to us having to drop some of the extra requirements for our project. Our project does not have a separate organized calendar or a dashboard organized by semester. Instead, we have made a general dashboard that allows users to keep track of important events with one main calendar. We also did not include colour-coded events; instead, we had everything as one colour. Adding on to this, instead of having a mini-deadline list with things for the next few days, we decided to keep the entire list so the user can see everything they need instead of being limited to the next few days. We scratched adding a user's name as it was too complicated to have the calendar save names associated with that nameâ€™s course, semester, etc. Finally, we did not implement the finished tasks at the top, and we felt it was unnecessary since the user did not need to see what tasks they had already finished. Instead, the list will be available on the side to show the user any unfinished tasks. Adding on to this, it was hard to cover all of our project requirements due to the absence of one team member; the workload of three had shifted down to two people; therefore, simplifying the design of our project was necessary for us to finish the project on time.
